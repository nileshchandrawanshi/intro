Regression Testing in CI Pipeline:

Triggering Tests: Regression tests are automatically initiated when a pull request (PR) is created or merged into the develop branch, ensuring continuous validation of code changes.
Ensuring Stability: These tests verify that recent updates do not disrupt existing functionality, maintaining application stability throughout development.
Integration with CI: The regression tests are integrated into the CI pipeline, allowing for immediate feedback and quick identification of issues before deployment to further environments.
